## Restaurant Reviews Stage 3
### Project Overview
This project is the continuation of Restaurant Reviews Stage 2 by taking the responsive, accessible, and offline first design built in Stage 1 and 2 and add additional functionalities. There is a form to allow users to create their own reviews. If the app is offline, the form will defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. Finally, the site is optimized to meet performance benchmarks tested using Lighthouse.
